An exploratory data analysis looking at participation of South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control's Adopt-A-Beach volunteer litter pickup program. My goals for this project were to find and use a novel dataset, begin working with Jupyter notebooks (instead of my usual R Markdown documents), and to look at the participation rates for the Adopt-a-Beach program to determine its success.
