Marine debris, which can be defined as any solid, man-made product or material that ends up in our coastal environments, threatens wildlife, economies, and human health and safety. Adopt-A-Beach partners participate in beach cleanups, remove debris from our beaches and coastal waterways, and provide marine debris collection data to DHEC.\n\nAdopt-A-Beach is part of [MyCoast: South Carolina](https://mycoast.org/sc): an online portal for SCDHEC to collect and analyze pictures and data relating to South Carolina's coast. According to the MyCoast South Carolina website, SCDHEC uses this information \"*...to visualize the impact of coastal hazards and to enhance awareness among decision-makers and stakeholders.*\"\n\n## About the data \nData is collected by volunteer participants who log marine debris/trash picked up during beach cleanups using the MyCoast app. The reports are available for viewing and downloading [here](https://mycoast.org/beach-cleanup/reportlist?stateLong=South+Carolina). Each observation in the dataset represents a beach cleanup that occured using the MyCoast app from April 2016 to present (October 7, 2021).\nData collected through the Adopt-A-Beach program provides valuable insight into the state of South Carolina's beaches. This data can be used for strategic planning and to drive policy changes in South Carolina to help protect the state's beaches, which are an important natural resource for residents and wildlife, as well as a crucial part of South Carolina's tourism economy.\n\n## About the analysis\nThe goal of this analysis is to identify trends in partipication in Adopt-A-Beach to find new growth opportunities for the program.\n\n### Questions for the analysis\n1. What are some of the overall trends in the partipication in the Adopt-A-Beach cleanup program?\n1. How can we leverage these trends to attract new participants to the program?\n1. How can we retain participants and help them stay engaged in the program?\n1. What are the limitations of the program/app/data? How can we make the data more valuable to SCDHEC and the public?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Preparation\nLet's start by loading the necessary packages, importing the data, and combining it into one dataset.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# creating custom ggplot theme\ntheme_dc <- function(){ \n  font <- \"Roboto\"   #assign font family up front\n  \n  theme_minimal() %+replace%    #replace elements we want to change\n    \n    theme(\n      \n      #grid elements\n      panel.grid.major = element_blank(),    #strip major gridlines\n      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),    #strip minor gridlines\n      axis.ticks = element_blank(),          #strip axis ticks\n      \n      #since theme_minimal() already strips axis lines, \n      #we don't need to do that again\n      axis.line = element_line(color = '#d3d3d3'),\n      \n      #text elements\n      plot.title = element_text(             #title\n        family = 'serif',            #set font family\n        size = 20,                #set font size\n        face = 'bold',            #bold typeface\n        color = '#595959',        #change color\n        hjust = 0,                #left align\n        vjust = 2),               #raise slightly\n      \n      plot.subtitle = element_text(          #subtitle\n        family = font,            #font family\n        size = 14,                #font size\n        color = '#595959',        #change color\n        hjust = 0),               #left align\n      \n      plot.caption = element_text(           #caption\n        family = font,            #font family\n        size = 9,                 #font size\n        hjust = 1),               #right align\n      \n      axis.title = element_text(             #axis titles\n        family = font,            #font family\n        size = 18,                #font size\n        color = '#595959',        #font color\n        hjust = 1),               #alignment\n        \n      axis.text = element_text(              #axis text\n        family = font,            #axis family\n        size = 18,                #font size\n        color = '#595959'),       #font color\n      \n      axis.text.x = element_text(            #margin for axis text\n        margin = margin(5, b = 10),\n        size = 18)\n    )\n}","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-27T22:15:15.298119Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-27T22:15:15.299884Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-27T22:15:15.314847Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":44,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(modeest)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n# import data\ncleanups2016 <- read_csv('../input/sc-beach-cleanups/2016_BeachCleanups.csv')\ncleanups2017 <- read_csv('../input/sc-beach-cleanups/2017_BeachCleanups.csv')\ncleanups2018 <- read_csv('../input/sc-beach-cleanups/2018_BeachCleanups.csv')\ncleanups2019 <- read_csv('../input/sc-beach-cleanups/2019_BeachCleanups.csv')\ncleanups2020 <- read_csv('../input/sc-beach-cleanups/2020_BeachCleanups.csv')\ncleanups2021 <- read_csv('../input/sc-beach-cleanups/2021_BeachCleanups.csv')\n\n#combine data\nbeachCleanups <- bind_rows(\n  cleanups2016, \n  cleanups2017, \n  cleanups2018, \n  cleanups2019,\n  cleanups2020,\n  cleanups2021,\n)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-27T21:46:34.918040Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-27T21:46:34.919692Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-27T21:46:38.091077Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Cleaning the data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"head(beachCleanups)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-27T21:46:48.373676Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-27T21:46:48.375982Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-27T21:46:48.405922Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A quick look with the `head()` function shows there's some cleaning to do:\n- There is an irrelevant \"Details\" column that needs removing (the data was pulled from a webpage table and the Details column linked to another page with further info on each cleanup -

I would imagine this was due to the covid-19 pandemic. It's important to note that most of the public beaches along the South Carolina coast were closed during the spring and summer of 2020 and have since reopened. There is some good news from the visualization: **the number of participants has risen 164% from 2020 to 2021** (and as of writing this it is only October 10, 2021 and the last data entry is from October 2, 2021), so there is an indication that participation will be back on the rise as beaches have reopened and recreation has resumed along the coast. \n\nOne important thing to note for this dataset is that **there is no information on how many individuals make up each group**, so we cannot truly know how many individual persons (in both groups and as individuals) participated in the program nor can we complete any analysis on the individual/per-person level.

Still, this information is important to note as it seems that groups overall are having more of an impact than individuals and the Adopt-A-Beach program managers might be interested in encouraging and boosting their participation.\n\nLastly, I want to look at how group and individual participation has trended over the years.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Cleanups\n\nbeachCleanups %>%\n  group_by(year = year(date), type) %>% \n  summarize(total_cleanups = n()) %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(year, total_cleanups, fill = type), position = 'dodge') +\n  labs(title = 'Adopt-A-Beach Cleanups by Participant Type',\n       subtitle = 'Groups vs Individuals, 2016–2021',\n       x = NULL,\n       y = 'Number of Cleanups'\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2016:2021) +\n  theme_dc() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#1ab7ea',\n                             '#404040'))\n\n# Items\nbeachCleanups %>%\n  group_by(year = year(date), type) %>% \n  summarize(total_items = sum(items)) %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(year, total_items, fill = type), position = 'dodge') +\n  labs(title = 'Adopt-A-Beach Items by Participant Type',\n       subtitle = 'Groups vs Individuals, 2016 – 2021',\n       x = NULL,\n       y = 'Number of Items'\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2016:2021) +\n  theme_dc() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#1ab7ea',\n                             '#404040'))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-27T22:52:10.292238Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-27T22:52:10.294183Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-27T22:52:10.912159Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":75,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It's interesting to see that **group cleanups and items picked up have increased over the years while individual cleanups and items picked up has decreased**. I was surprised to see greater numbers of group activity in 2020 and 2021 during the covid-19 pandemic. Due to social distancing I had expected to see lower group activity. Perhaps since cleanups take place outside, participants feel that beach cleanups are a safe group actvity? Further investigation is needed, however, this information will be important to share with program managers.\n\n# Summary and Recommendations\n\n- Overall, participation in the Adopt-A-Beach program has fallen. **While the number of participants was growing up until the 2020 covid-19 pandemic, the number of cleanups has steadily declined (down 45% from 2017)**. **The majority of participants are only ever completing one cleanup, rather than the two per year requested by the program**. A survey of participants is recommended to collect more data on their experience with the program and app and to provide insight as to why the program abandonment rate is so high.\n\n- Seasonal trends show that **more cleanups are completed in the summer months**, presumably due to the warmer weather that time of year. This seasonality can be leveraged when making decisions around the marketing and promotion of the Adopt-A-Beach program.\n\n- Participation trends show that **group participation is on the rise and that groups pick up more items than individuals**. While more investigation is needed (perhaps to be included in the recommended survey), it does seem that groups are having more of an impact than individuals and the Adopt-A-Beach program might be interested in encouraging and boosting their participation.\n\n- Again, a survey and more data is needed to troubleshoot how to retain participants and help them stay engaged in the program. User experience with the MyCoast app is an important area to investigate further, as the logging of each individual item picked up might be too tedious for most participants. Program information and education is another area to explore, to be sure that participants understand the expectations of the program, as well as the value of their work and participation.\n\n- Lastly, **the data currently lacks the number of persons that make up each group**. This significantly limits the scope of the analysis to the per-cleanup level. It is not possible at this time to calculate how many individual persons (in both groups and as individuals) participated in the program. In addition, valuable metrics, such as the average items picked up per person per hour, cannot be calculated. The data would serve SCDHEC and the public better if group size were included. This information should be shared with the program managers and MyCoast app development team, to see if this data can be made available or if changes can be made to the app so this data is recorded for future use.\n","metadata":{}}]}
